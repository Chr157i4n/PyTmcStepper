# TMC_2209_Raspberry_Pi
this is a libary to drive a stepper motor with a TMC2209 stepper driver and a Raspberry Pi

this code is still experimental, so use it on your own risk.

My TMC2209 is a driver from Watterott:
https://shop.watterott.com/SilentStepStick-TMC2209-V2_1

It has a rSense of 110 mOhm and it uses one Pin (PDN_UART) for UART RX and TX.
So the PD_UART-Pin needs to be connected to the Raspberrry Pis RX-Pin directly and to the TX-Pin with an 1kOhm resistor
You can read more about this in the datasheet from Trinamic:
https://www.trinamic.com/products/integrated-circuits/details/tmc2209-la/

Because the Raspberry Pis UART Receive Pin (RX) is connected to the transmit Pin of the Pi (TX), the Pi also receives what it sends.
If you have a different driver with TX and RX this is not the case.

Well, in my case the Pi receive 4 bits from itself and 8 bit from the driver.
When the driver has a shared TX/RX Pin the Pi receive 12 bit instead of 8.

the code to run the stepper motor is based on the code of the AccelStepper Libary from Mike McCauley

the code for the uart communicationis based on this code from troxel
